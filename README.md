# SŠPU - SFML ukázka

This program is in no way representative of what a well written C++ application should look like. The purpose of this application is to quickly showcase the SFML graphics library in a high school class. The program is meant to be written with high school students, by high school students, during a short class, where there is little time to spend designing a proper application, which is a task outside the scope of this class.
